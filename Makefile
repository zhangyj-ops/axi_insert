#########################
# ---- Introduction ----
#########################

# Welcome to the VeriSimpleV Makefile!
# this file will allow you to build a fully synthesizable verilog processor
# it should need only minimal changes, if any, for use in project 3
# but will be reused for project 4 and will need updates as you add new files and functionality
# this will mostly be editing SIMFILES, SYNFILES, and TESTBENCH in the executable compilation section
# but feel free to mess around! There are plenty of comments on different make features
# and you should try things out. But make sure you commit changes to git before you break things!

# here's a table contents with make targets for reference:

# ---- Module Testbenches ----
# make <module>_simv     <- compile the verilog executable for a module's testbench
# make <module>.vg       <- synthesize the module (not the testbench) to a synth/<module>.vg file
# make <module>_syn_simv <- compile the verilog executable for a module's synthesis testbench
# make <module>.sim      <- run the module testbench and save the output to output/<module>.sim.out
# make <module>.syn      <- run the synthesis testbench and save the output to output/<module>.syn.out
# make <module>.verdi     <- run a module testbench in verdi via <module>_simv
# make <module>.syn.verdi <- run a module testbench in verdi via <module>_syn_simv
# NOTE: these expect a module verilog/<module>.sv with a corresponding testbench/<module>_tb.sv

# ---- Executable Compilation ----
# make simv     <- compile the verilog executable simv from the testbench and SIMFILES
# make syn_simv <- compile the synthesis executable syn_simv from the testbench and SYNFILES

# ---- Program Memory Compilation ----
# NOTE: programs to run are in the test_progs/ directory
# make <my_program>.mem <- creates the program memory file output/<my_program>.mem for running on simv etc

# ---- Dump Files ----
# make <my_program>.dump_numeric <- creates a numeric dump file for viewing the disassembled source code
# make <my_program>.dump_abi     <- creates an abi dump file for viewing the disassembled source code
# make <my_program>.dump         <- creates both of the above files  at once and is easier to type :)
# make <my_program>.debug.dump_* <- creates dump files for C programs that intersperses the C source code

# ---- Program Execution ----
# NOTE: these should be your main commands for running programs and generating output
# make <my_program>.out     <- run a program on simv and generate .out and .wb output in output/
# make <my_program>.syn.out <- run a program on syn_simv and do the same

# ---- Verdi ----
# make <my_program>.verdi     <- run a program in the verdi debugger via simv
# make <my_program>.syn.verdi <- the same but via syn_simv

# ---- Visual Debugger ----
# make <my_program>.vis <- run a program on the project 3 vtuber visual debugger!
# make vis_simv         <- compile the vtuber executable from visual_testbench.sv and the SIMFILES

# ---- Cleanup ----
# make clean <- remove most created files except specific synthesis files and .mem files
# make nuke  <- remove all files created from make rules

# each of these will compile/run any of their dependencies as needed, and needs no other
# commands to be called first, this is one of the major improvements from the legacy system
# which would require recompiling multiple files before each run of a different program on simv

# I've also added the targets: compile_all dump_all simulate_all simulate_all_syn
# that respectively compile, dump, and simulate EVERY program in test_progs/ at once
# NOTE: you can use the -j flag with make to allow make to run multithreaded to finish these faster
# although this will make color printing funky because of the interleaved output

# credits:
# VeriSimpleV was created by Jielun Tan and has been edited by at least:
# Nevil Pooniwala, Xueyang Liu, Cassie Jones, James Connolly, and Ian Wrzesinski
# the current layout and updates to the Makefile (Jan 2023) were made by Ian Wrzesinski
# other instructors have also likely edited it, but it's hard to find their names in our messy bitbucket
# so this is a specific shoutout to them: thank you all!
# and massive thanks to Jielun Tan for creating VeriSimpleV and his continuous work on it!

# <25 is expected, <20 is good, and <6.66 causes memory to run out of tags (100ns/15 cycles)
# although these numbers are vague ideas, and you should base them on *your* processor's performance
# and don't worry about getting the absolute minimum clock period possible, but do minimize it somewhat

# NOTE: synthesis will target this value, but doesn't go farther; you can have 0.0 slack and still decrease

#   0:black, 1:red, 2:green, 3:yellow, 4:blue, 5:magenta, 6:cyan, 7:white
# third, echo the message
# finally, reset the terminal color (but still only if a terminal)
# make functions are called like this:
# $(call PRINT_COLOR,5,msg)
# add '@' at the start of the line so it doesn't print the command itself, only the output

GREP = grep --color=auto

###########################
# ---- Default Target ----
###########################

# The first make rule is the default target and is run when calling 'make' by itself
# it is often called "all" by convention, but you can change it to anything
# don't place any other make targets above this

all: simv
# make won't check for the existence of .PHONY targets, and will run their commands every time
# since this is generally what we want for all, we declare it as phony like so:
.PHONY: all

###############################
# ---- Module Testbenches ----
###############################

# create module testbenches for your modules, and update the TESTED_MODULES variable below
# these targets expect you to follow the naming convention:
# for a module verilog/rob.sv
# declares a module named rob
# with a testbench as testbench/rob_tb.sv

# quick target reference:
# make <module>_simv      <- compile the testbench executable
# make <module>.sim       <- run the testbench (output is output/<module>.sim.out)
# make <module>.vg        <- synthesize the module (not the testbench)
# make <module>_syn_simv  <- compile the synthesis executable
# make <module>.syn       <- run the synthesis testbench (output is output/<module>.syn.out)
# make <module>.verdi     <- run in verdi via <module>_simv
# make <module>.syn.verdi <- run in verdi via <module>_syn_simv

# if your module is verilog/rob.sv, add rob to TESTED_MODULES
# and make your testbench file: testbench/rob_tb.sv

# if you make your testbenches print @@@Passed or @@@Failed
# you can use the 'testbench_passed' target below to quickly view success/failure

# example for an execute_stage module that uses mult:
#   execute_stage_simv: mult.sv
#   synth/execute_stage.vg: mult.sv

# ---- Executable Compilation ----
###################################

# These are the files and recipes for compiling the verilog executables simv and syn_simv
# Note that for projects 3/4, the executable is not the only thing you need to compile
# you must also create a .mem file for the program you're running that will be loaded
# into mem.sv's memory data by the testbench on startup.

# To actually run a program on simv or syn_simv, see the program compilation section later
# you can also use the legacy targets 'sim' and 'syn' that use the legacy program.mem file

# start by testing individual modules in the module testbench section above
# only edit this section once you're ready to test your full processor

# the old processor does not compile with the CACHE_MODE flag defined in sys_defs.svh
# it is your job to update your processor work with this mode
# the included icache.sv module should be a good starting place
# and you should update SIMFILES to compile your files when you start to test the full processor
# the old *_stage.sv files have been included for your reference in verilog/old_verilog/

# delete this comment area when you want to

# if you want to restore the original processor functionality temporarily:
# (i.e. when testing non-memory functionality)
# 1. comment out CACHE_MODE in sys_defs
# 2. define MEM_LATENCY_IN_CYCLES as 0 in sys_defs
# 3. set SIMFILES = pipeline.sv regfile.sv $(wildcard verilog/old_verilog/*_stage.sv)
# your final processor must work with CACHE_MODE enabled and the 100ns memory latency

# NOTE: we're able to write these filenames without directories due to the VPATH declaration above
# Make will automatically expand these to their actual paths when used in recipes

# you compile those into a link file by using the riscv assembler or compiler
# then you convert that assembly to a .mem hex file

# see: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html#Text-Functions
# it's technically equivalent to calling the function: $(patsubst pattern,replacement,$(var))
# but the better syntax is: $(var:pattern=replacement)
# the percent sign '%' acts as the wildcard, and can be reused in the replacement
# if you don't include the percent it automatically attempts to replace just the suffix of the input

# second, it creates a 'static pattern rule' that turns all the elements of the variable into targets

# ---- Dump Files ----
#######################

# it can also be usefule to look at dump files that represent the compiled riscv assembly code
# there are two types, which are useful for debugging different things:
#   1. dump_numeric gives dump files where the registers use their numeric values, better for debugging
#      with verdi in the waveform view
#   2. dump_abi gives dump files where the registers use their named values as written in the sources
#      this is better for testing that your assembly matches a source file you wrote
# these match the legacy 'disassemble' target (dump_abi is .dump, and dump_numeric is .debug.dump)

# this creates the <my_program>.debug.elf targets, which can be used in: 'make <my_program>.debug.dump_*'
# these are useful for the C sources because the debug flag makes the assembly more understandable
# because it includes some of the original C operations and function/variable names
# NOTE: static pattern make rules generally need their dependencies to be above them in the makefile
# otherwise you can get the 'No rule to make target' error, due to being unable to find a dependency

# ---- Legacy program.mem Compilation System ----
##################################################

# This is the old system for compiling programs, it required you to run
# 'make assembly' or 'make program' for Assembly vs C code SOURCE
# in order to to create "program.mem" which would be overwritten every time
# and which was hardcoded in the testbench.sv file for loading into memory.
# It would also create the hardcoded program.out, writeback.out, (and pipeline.out - not for p4)
# files which would also be overwritten every time.
# This doesn't follow the way Make is meant to be used for creating files and
# the new compilation system should be used instead.
# However I only have so much time to edit both this and the autograder
# this semester, so I'm leaving this for backwards compatibility.
# running simv or syn_simv with no arguments will still load "program.mem" into memory

# the source program for the legacy system
# NOTE: you can override this at the command line like: 'make SOURCE=test_progs/<my_program.s/.c>'
# this however always recompiles program.mem and is inefficient vs the new system
